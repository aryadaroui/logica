## logica
Logica is an amalgamation of different waveform editing effects I experiment with. The more basic, logic based effects are as follows:

| Effect                   | Logic   |
| ------------------------ | ------- |
| Normal                   | p ⟶ q   |
| Inverse                  | q ⟶ p   |
| Converse                 | -p ⟶ -q |
| Reverse (Contrapositive) | -q ⟶ -p |

This probably won't make much sense until I make images for the waveforms, so hopefully nobody looks at this until then.
